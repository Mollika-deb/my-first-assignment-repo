            <p>The city is alone in the flood waters of the village. Internet communication with the whole country,
                including
                electricity connection, has become very disconnected. As a result, communication with relatives on mobile
                phones has
                almost stopped. Road and rail communication is also very poor and even at the airport the aircraft is not
                taking off and
                landing. The whole area alone in the water. There is no way to understand which field and which ghat! Risk
                of extensive
                damage.</p>
